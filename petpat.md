# Pet Pat üêæ

> A gamified goal achievement platform where your virtual pets grow with your success

Pet Pat combines Web3 incentives with emotional engagement through virtual pets that evolve based on your goal completion progress. Stake PAT tokens, set milestones, submit evidence, and watch your pet companion grow as you achieve your dreams.

## üéØ Overview

Pet Pat is a decentralized goal achievement platform that uses:
- **Staking Mechanics**: Put PAT tokens at risk to create commitment
- **Virtual Pet NFTs**: Dynamic companions that evolve with your progress  
- **Community Validation**: Decentralized milestone verification system
- **Tiered Rewards**: Higher stakes unlock better reward multipliers
- **Emotional Gamification**: Pet mood and evolution create psychological investment

### Smart Contract System

| Contract | Purpose | Key Features |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **PATToken** | ERC20 utility token | Burn mechanics, reward distribution, max 100M supply |
| **PatGoalManager** | Goal lifecycle management | Creates goals, tracks milestones, handles completion/failure |
| **PatNFT** | Dynamic pet NFTs | 3 types, 3 evolution stages, mood system, XP tracking |
| **PatTreasuryManager** | Tokenomics & rewards | 5-tier reward system, pool distribution, stake management |
| **PatValidationSystem** | Community governance | Validator staking, reputation scoring, decentralized validation |

## üöÄ Core Features

### Goal Creation Flow
1. **Stake PAT Tokens** (10-50,000 PAT based on tier)
2. **Choose Pet Type** (Dragon üêâ, Cat üê±, or Plant üå±)
3. **Set Milestones** with clear success criteria
4. **Receive Pet NFT** in "Egg" stage

### Milestone Progress
1. **Submit Evidence** (photos, documents, proof of work)
2. **Community Validation** (3-7 validators based on stake size)
3. **Earn XP** (25 XP per approved milestone)
4. **Pet Evolution** (Egg ‚Üí Baby at 100 XP, Baby ‚Üí Adult at 500 XP)

### Reward System
| Stake Tier | PAT Range | Reward Multiplier | Tier Name |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Tier 1 | 10-99 PAT | 110% | Sprout üå± |
| Tier 2 | 100-499 PAT | 125% | Bloom üå∏ |
| Tier 3 | 500-1,999 PAT | 150% | Flourish üå∫ |
| Tier 4 | 2,000-9,999 PAT | 200% | Thrive üå≥ |
| Tier 5 | 10,000+ PAT | 300% | Legend üèÜ |

## üéÆ Pet System

### Pet Types & Evolution
```
ü•ö EGG STAGE (0-99 XP)
    ‚Üì (100 XP threshold)
üë∂ BABY STAGE (100-499 XP)  
    ‚Üì (500 XP threshold)
ü¶∏ ADULT STAGE (500+ XP)
```

### Pet Characteristics
- **Dynamic Metadata**: Appearance changes with evolution and mood
- **Mood System**: Happy pets for success, sad pets for setbacks
- **Experience Points**: Earned through milestone completion
- **Rarity Traits**: Based on evolution stage and achievements

### Pet Types
- **üêâ Dragon**: Mythical companion for ambitious goals
- **üê± Cat**: Loyal friend for personal development
- **üå± Plant**: Growing companion for habit formation

## üí∞ Tokenomics

### PAT Token Distribution
- **Total Supply**: 100,000,000 PAT
- **Initial Mint**: 50,000,000 PAT
- **Remaining**: Minted through rewards and platform growth

### Treasury Pool Allocation (from failed stakes)
- **60% Reward Pool**: Future goal completion bonuses
- **25% Insurance Pool**: Platform stability and edge cases  
- **10% Validator Pool**: Community validation rewards
- **5% Development Pool**: Platform development and maintenance
- **10% Burned**: Deflationary pressure (from failed stakes)

### Validator Economics
- **Minimum Stake**: 50 PAT to become validator
- **Base Reward**: 5 PAT per validation
- **Accuracy Bonus**: +25% for correct validations
- **Reputation System**: Score affects assignment probability
